1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and both sugars until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.

5. Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips.

6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

7. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. The centers should still look slightly underdone.

8. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
